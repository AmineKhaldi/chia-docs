[WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.com) is a communications protocol that allows decentralized applications (dApps) and wallets to securely interact with each other. Chia supports WalletConnect and exposes various RPCs for requesting wallet actions from a web application.

## Getting Started

You can install our [example WalletConnect dApp](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-wallet-connect-dapp-test) and run it in your browser to test out WalletConnect. The code can be adapted for use in your own React applications.
